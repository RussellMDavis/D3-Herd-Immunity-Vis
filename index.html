    <h1> Visualizing the Global Relationship between Vaccines and Disease Incidence Rate </h1>
	<p> Measles is one of the leading causes of death among children according to the World Health Organization. Vaccines save lives by reducing the number of disease incidents. Avoiding or delaying vaccination can cause people to succumb to commonly vaccinated diseases leading to illness, permanent long-term health effects, or even death. There is a strong link between vaccines and reduction of disease incidents. </p>
	<p> The red map below shows the number of disease incidents in the human population in various countries. The color changes according to the percentage of the population infected with a disease in a given year. The green map starts by showing the percent of people in particular countries who are vaccinated. The darkest color shows herd immunity which is the a status where there are enough vaccinated people in the population that those that are not vaccinated are unlikely to become infected. </p>
	<p> You can use the selectors to look at different diseases or different years for the same disease. Hovering over a country will give you more information about that country and the disease and population. You can also use the top most selector to compare two disease maps to each other. This will make it easy to compare the number of measles outbreaks today to measles outbreaks in a previous year. Explore the data yourself to find out how vaccines really do save lives! </p>
