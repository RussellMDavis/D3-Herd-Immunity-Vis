# Overview

The main goal of this project is to illustrate people on the importance and efficacy of vaccines in reducing disease rates. 
It used two visualizations: one for showing disease prevalence and one for showing either vaccine percentage or the prevalence of a disease of a different type or time depending on what mode is selected. 
Disease maps are shown in red because it is a threatening color, where vaccine maps are shown in green. 
Tooltips give additional information to aid understanding and show particular values.
